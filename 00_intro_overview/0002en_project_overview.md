* Familiarize with Model-View-Template-URL architecture. Explain `CRUD` concept for a model. Go through CRUD functionality of Task on the front-end, then admin.
* Analyze the project's file structure (`manage.py`, project, apps). 
* Go over through the code responsible for the urls, views, templates, models. Outline the general app architecture.
* Get over project/app achitecture by using `urls.py` file at the project level.
* Familiarize with `settings.py` and the concept of `local_settings.py`.
